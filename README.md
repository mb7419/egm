******************************

**Evidence Gap Maps(egm)** are useful in research for plotting research gaps for a research area. This library (extension of the [Bubbly]( https://github.com/AashitaK/bubbly) package) provides interactive and animated charts using *Plotly* that can be useful to view reasearch gaps and tracking time based progress of relevant research. The animated bubble charts can accommodate up to six variables viz. X-axis, Y-axis, time, bubbles (the research artifacts of title , abstract and doi) their size (similarity to research question) and their color in a compact and captivating way. Evidence Gap Maps are easy to use with plenty of customization, especially suited for use in Jupyter notebooks and is designed to work with ``plotly``'s offline mode such as in Kaggle kernels. These plots can also be useful to plot two catagorical variable as bins.
